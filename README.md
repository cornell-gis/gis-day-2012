# GIS Day 2012



Friday, November 9, 2012 \
Mann Library 102

GIS Day is held each November during Geography Awareness Week, with events in more than 80 countries. Local events in Ithaca are organized by members of SynerGIS, a diverse group of GIS professionals, managers, and students from Cornell, Tompkins County, and the surrounding area. (Yes, our local event is being held a bit earlier than the official date, due to scheduling constraints.)

## Iron Mapper

We are very excited to host (with the help of Diana Sinton) a new event this year: Iron Mapper! Inspired by "Iron Chefs", contestants will have 60 minutes to make a map using a "secret" data layer that will be revealed at the start of the event. This will be an event to remember for all time... an epic map battle to determine who rules the (cartographic) world. The number of contestants will be limited, so register now!

*UPDATE: This event was re-scheduled for December 5, 2012.*

Congratulations to our winners, Nick Hollingshead (Iron Mapper 2012!) and Dave Bubniak (runner up)!
